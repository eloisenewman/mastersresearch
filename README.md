# Hot and Bothered
## How does temperature affect sex-specific aggressive behaviour between two different coexisting species?

Welcome to the repository for the data and code I wrote for my masters project (2021-2022) on intrasexual aggression in two species of fruit flies. There are two key files if you would like to replicate my analysis:

- Data Tidying.Rmd - how I wrangled and tidied the raw behavioural dataset from BORIS and of observational data. 
- Analysis.Rmd - contains methodology in how I approached testing 'aggression' at different temperatures. Contains statistical analysis (generalised linear models, dispersion tests etc.). Also contains code to reproduce graphs contained in my dissertation. 

If you would like a copy of my dissertation, please email me: newman.eloise@gmail.com. The analysis code contains an extended commentary on methodology and interpretation of results.
